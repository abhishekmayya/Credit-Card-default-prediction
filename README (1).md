# Credit Card Default Prediction Project

![8-2RwSsEMyyzLZUzi](https://github.com/ShreyanshAcharya/Credit_card_default_prediction/assets/59439172/9731e2c0-99b2-4791-b4bf-647d09b09356)


## Overview

This project aims to predict instances of customers defaulting on their credit card payments. With a risk management perspective in mind, accurately predicting whether a customer is likely to default on their bills in future terms holds significant importance for financial institutions.

The predictive model developed in this project can assist in identifying customers who are at a higher risk of defaulting on their credit card payments. This information can be crucial for financial institutions to proactively manage and mitigate potential financial risks.

## Project Contents

1. **Dataset:** The project utilizes a dataset containing historical information about customers, including their credit card usage, payment history, and other relevant features.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the distribution of key variables.

3. **Feature Engineering:** The creation of new features or transformation of existing features to enhance the predictive power of the model.

4. **Model Development:** The project involves building a predictive model using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, or other appropriate models. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques are employed to optimize model performance.

5. **Evaluation:** The model's performance is assessed using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. A confusion matrix is also generated to visualize the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.
